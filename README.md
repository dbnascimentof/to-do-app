## Objective
This repository was created as part of the android developer journey. The main objective is to explore and develop android development skills while trying to simulate as close as possible the reality of real-life tech teams in real world.

For this project we are going to explore concepts like:
 - Android development
 - Git version control
 - Agile methodologies (Scrum / Kanban)
 - Agile ceremonies (Planning, refinement, review and retrospectives)
 - Agile teams roles and responsibilities
 - Slicing big projects into small deliverables with the MVP concept.

## Design
The design for this project will be based on Margarita Deyneto's to-do app concept for a simple yet very useful and pretty to-do app. 
More details about the design can be seen at Margarita's [behance page](https://www.behance.net/gallery/72614427/To-Do-App-Concept)
